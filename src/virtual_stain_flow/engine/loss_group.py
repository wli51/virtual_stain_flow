loss_group.py

LossGroup and LossItem classes for managing related loss computations.

This abstraction is motivated by the complexity of managing computation
    of losses from separate forward passes during the same training step,
    which happens in wGAN training. 

Also serves as a way to centralize device management and loss weight control.

The intended use of this module is by trainer classes, which should initialize
    LossItem and LossGroup objects as part of their setup, and then generate
    a dictionary of tensors containing all results of a forward pass and then
    call the LossGroup object directly to arrive at the total loss, and simpify
    the trainer logic substantially.

Note that this module is only responsible for loss computation and 
    weighted accumulation. Requires properly orchestrated forward passes
    and context management upstream by the forward_group module and
    trainer classes. See docstrings in those modules for details.
